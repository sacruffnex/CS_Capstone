## Software Design & Engineering Enhancement

### Luxury Ocean Cruise Outings Booking Program

What is this program?

This program was created for the Luxury Ocean Cruise Outings Company to coordinate cruise bookings.  I built it in December 2019 in Southern New Hampshire University's (SNHU) IT-145 Foundations in Applications Development course.  It operates via a text-based menu that allows the user to add, edit and print ships, cruises and passengers.  It initially only allowed for the user to add and print but not the edit functions.  This is why I selected this specific program.

How did I update this program?

I updated the program to handle the edit functions while utilizing the system specification document to ensure all needs were met.  I also input exit paths into each of the program's branches.  I tested all the cases I could think of and each passed and correctly output what was requested.  Enhancing this program strengthened my software development skills with a language I'm not as familiar with, such as Python.

What I learned from updating this program.

I underestimated the time I needed to finish this.  If I was familiar with the program and language, it would've taken me a few hours.  Due to the lack of both, it took me around 20 hours.  This stressed the importance of estimating a realistic time of completion.  I also learned how useful [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is to developers.  Having a community to assist you is similar to having teammates ready and willing to help.

### SNHU Travel Company Slide Show

What is this program?

This program was created for the SNHU Travel Company as a booking tool assistant.  This was built in March 2020 in SNHU's CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course.  It oringinally displayed the top five wellness destinations based on customer feedback.

How did I update this program?

I selected this program because there was some customer feedback that wasn't implemented.  The feedback was for viewing top cruise and museum destinations.  First, I started by creating new user stories based on the feedback.  Each user story described different details about the program that they want implemented.  Next, I created new test cases to use against the new features.  The test cases detailed what the program should do and what to display.  Finally, I updated the slide show to show the top five wellness, cruise and museum destinations.

What I learned from updating this program.

I learned how to create and update a simple GUI-based program.  Once again, I referenced [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) a lot.  I also had to reteach myself how the program operated and how each module worked with each other.  There was a lot of trial and error that taught me different ways to accomplish my objective.
